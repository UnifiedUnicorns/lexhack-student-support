# Special Calculator by Ethan Xie and Jacob Wang
Special Calculator is a geometry tool made to help calculate things that might otherwise take a long time. Not only is it able to calculate the volume and surface area of many solids, area and perimeter of shapes, and the quadratic formula, but it also has a show me feature to show the formula that was used to calculate. It can also generate random quadratic equations for the user to do. Overall, if you just want to quickly calculate something, it can do it for you.
