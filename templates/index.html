        This is Special Calculator, which is a special calculator that is very special because
        it is a calculator to do your work when you're too lazy. It contains multiple functions
        to calculate special things like quadratic equations, and volume/surface area of solids.

        Also, if you're too lazy or too busy, use our award-winning(perhaps maybe possibly)
        Special Training feature to practice math skills and check your answers.
